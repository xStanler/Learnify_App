# **Learnify App**

Welcome in Learnify App project. It's simple app that solves my needs for learing new words / concepts. Someone may say that it looks and works similiar to Duoling, but that's not right. It generates lessons based by topic of choice. App takes chooses words/cards based on self-made validation algorithm and then checks users knowledge of current topic (Somthing like Aanki). Learnify© was made for people by people (one person to be exact).
